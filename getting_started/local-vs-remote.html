<p>So you've added your code to your machine and you are making changes. There is an entire process to getting your code save and uploaded back to GitHub.</p>

<p>Here are a few things that you will need to know before we continue.
<ul>
  <li>The repository that you got your code from is the <code>origin</code>.</li>
  <li>Any repository not on your computer) is referred to as a <code>remote</code> repository. </li>
  <li>Your local machine's code is simply referred to as the <code>local</code> repository.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>By default your code will always work with the <code>local</code> and <code>origin</code> repositories.
</p>
<h2>Fetching and Pulling</h2>
<p>When you are working with multiple people on a project, I highly recommend that you check the <code>origin</code> for any changes. This will prevent you from running into any major CONFLICTS later on.</p>

<p>To check for any changes you will need to run a <b>fetch</b> on <code>origin</code>.
</p>
<code>git fetch</code>

<p>If pulling changes from a branch other than origin/and the same branch you are on you, you will need to include it.</p>

<code>git fetch remote &ltsome-users-repo/their-branch&gt</code>

To update your code with the origin you will need to <code>git pull</code> information down from your origin (or some other) repository.
A <code>pull</code>, checks the code for any changes and then immediately tries to merge those changes with your local copy.

<h2>Commit</h2>
<p> When you are making changes, part of version control is making the versions. These are known as <b>commits</b>. Commits are records or reference that you can point to in your code.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you commit often and make your commits logical.</p>

<div class="lesson-content"><h3>We get it...Working on everything through github is not the best way to get things done.</h3>
<p>No one expects you to only work from the website (we actually recommend that you don't).</p>
<p>The best approach to working with your code is to <a href=/Git-Up-to-Speed/terms#clone><em>clone</em></a> your code to your local machine. There you can use tools and technology that you are comfortable with.</p>
<h3>If you have the Github Application Installed</h3>
<p>Select <b>Open in Desktop</b>. The GitHub Application will run and prompt you to select a local to save your repository.</p>

<h3>No Github Application (or You Don't Want to Use It)</h3>
<p>If you would rather not use the Github application you can <a href="#">clone</a> your Repository using <a href="#">Git</a>.
</p>

<b>NOTE:</b>Before you can do this, ensure that you have git <a href="./what_is_git.html#install">installed on your machine</a>.

  <p>On the <a href="/Git-Up-to-Speed/terms#repository-root">Repository Root Page</a> select the <b>Clone or Download</b> button and copy the path.</p>

  <b>NOTE:</b> You will need to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/">setup SSH</a> and provide an SSH Key for github to use SSH. In the meantime, you can select the use https. (You will need to provide a username and password ).</b>

  <p>Open your Terminal of choice and go to the location that you would like to store your Repository. Then run the command <code>git clone </code> and then paste in the url (space between clone and the url.) If you want to name the directory something other than the name of the repository, enter it after the url.

  <p>You are now able to work on your code from the comfort of your local files. But what about <a href="./local-vs-remote.html">sending your changes back to GitHub</a>?</p>

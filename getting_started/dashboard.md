# Your GitHub Dashboard

The GitHub dashboard is the screen that you will default to when you are logged into GitHub.

From the dashboard you can view updates from [repositories](../terms#Repository) that you follow.

You can also jump to [repositories](../terms#Repository) that you contribute to or your local [repositories](../terms#Repository)

### Now you're ready to *Create Your First Project*
**Go Back to [Getting Started](./introduction)**
